											<h1>About Me</h1>
											<h2>Nicholas Zaidan</h2>
										</header>
										<p>Graduate from the University of Sydney with a Bachelors of Computer Science and Information Technology.
											 Finished with a double major in Computer Science and Information Systems.</p>
										<p>I was born in Sydney but moved to Belgium at the age of 2, where I attended the British School of Brussels before moving to Hong Kong 6 years later. There 
												 I attended the Australian International School of Hong Kong, where I completed my Higher School Certificate. After living overseas for 16 years, I returned home to Australia to continue my education at the University of Sydney.</p>
										
										<p>During my time at University, I studied a range of computer science topics. These included Distributed Systems, Operating Systems, 
											Object Oriented Design, Algorithms & Complexity and Principles of Security & Security Engineering. 
											As a result, these subjects helped me become a better programmer by teaching me the inner workings and complexities of the operations 
											happening behind the screen. </br>They also taught me how to design efficient algorithms and data structures to maintain low operation and storage costs. 
										</p>
										<p>Additionally, I also studied a range of Information System topics such as System Analysis & Modelling, 
											Human Computer Interaction, Computing 2 & Usability and Management of IT Projects & Systems. 
											These subjects complemented my skillset as they taught me different values based on user end goals and how to design systems for general use. </p>
										
										<p>Alongside my studies at University, I also used my personal time to further research and understand other topics, 
											such as Artifical Intelligence and Game Development. This came about as a result of my keen interest in these subjects and a strong desire to develop my understanding and expand my knowledge base. 
											It also creates the opportunity for me to utilise these skills in any future projects, as many of the relevant concepts are transferable. Furthermore, I also developed an introductory level of proficiency in Android App Development for my Computer Science and Information Systems projects.</p>
